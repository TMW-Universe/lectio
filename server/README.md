# Lectio server

A server that merges books from different sources and stores user progress, collections and more.

## The standard

This project works as a data manager, which means it is not capable of obtaining books by himself. It requires external APIs that provide this data.
You can use the mangas API developed by the TMW Universe Team: https://github.com/TheMineWay/mangas-api.
